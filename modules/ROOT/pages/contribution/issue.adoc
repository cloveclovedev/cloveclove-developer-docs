= Issue Guidelines

== Issue type
* *Epic*: Large feature or initiative spanning several weeks to months.
* *Sub-issue*: Task that takes hours or longer and composes the Epic. Additional sub-levels are fine when they improve clarity.

== Title naming rules
* *Epic*: `Epic: {Title}`
** Examples:
*** `Epic: Payment v1`
* *Sub-issue* (any level): `[Slug] {Title}`
** Slug = short identifier of the parent Epic
** Examples:
*** `[Pay-v1] Create SetupIntent`
*** `[Pay-v1] Android: Integrate PaymentSheet`
*** `[Pay-v1] Retry billing_job on Stripe`

== Description rules

=== Epic Issue body must include
* `## Goal` — What success looks like and the business/customer value.
* `## Out of Scope` — Explicitly list what will *not* be done in this Epic.
* `## Acceptance Criteria` — Verifiable conditions of completion, including how each will be validated (test case, manual check, metric, etc.).

=== Sub-issue body should include
* Context / summary of the task.
* `## Action items` — Optional checklist of small tasks when helpful.

== Label rules
* *Epic*: add label `type/epic`.
* *Sub-issue*: add label `type/task`
* Add area labels as needed (e.g., `area/android`, `area/supabase`) to aid triage.

== Creating Linked Sub-issues via GitHub CLI
We use the https://github.com/yahsan2/gh-sub-issue[`gh-sub-issue`] GitHub CLI extension to create Sub-issues that are automatically linked to a parent Epic.

.Install the extension (once)
[,bash]
----
gh extension install yahsan2/gh-sub-issue
----

.Create a Sub-issue linked to a parent
[,bash]
----
gh sub-issue create <parent-issue-number> \
  --title "[Slug] {Title}" \
  --body "Short description and checklist of action items"
----

Replace `<parent-issue-number>` with the Epic issue number.
